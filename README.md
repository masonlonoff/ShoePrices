The dataset that I completeted analysis on is the "Shoe Prices dataset" created by KIATTISAK RATTANAPORN on Kaggle.

There are two files in this repository:

      1: Shoes.ipynb - This file contains initial EDA, data cleansing, and data visualization based on the dataset.
      
      
      2: For the models with the best two accuracies, I added hyperparameters and used cross val to find the best accuracy
