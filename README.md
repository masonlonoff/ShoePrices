# ShoePrices

The dataset that I completeted analysis on is the "Shoe Prices dataset" created by KIATTISAK RATTANAPORN on Kaggle.

There are two files in this repository:

      1: Shoes.ipynb - This file contains initial EDA, data cleansing, and data visualization based on the dataset.
      
      
      2: ShoesML.ipynb - This file contains ML algorithms that attempt to accurately predict shoe prices. I used Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support                              Vector Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest models. The SVR and Random Forest models performed the best, so I used add hyperparameters and                            cross-validation to try to find the best accuracy.
